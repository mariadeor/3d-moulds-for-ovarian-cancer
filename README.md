#  3D Moulds for Ovarian Cancer

Repository for the publication "Lesion-Specific 3D-Printed Moulds for Image-Guided Tissue Multi-Sampling of Ovarian Tumours: a prospective pilot study"

## Dependencies
The code in this repository runs on Python and has been developed and tested using Python 3.8.13. Necessary libraries and versions are in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. Required libraries can be installed by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inputs
* [*dicom\_info.yaml*](dicom_info.yaml): yaml file specifying:
  1. Path to the folder that contains both the DICOM images files and the DICOM-RT file.
  2. Names given to the ROIs (tumour, base, reference points) in the DICOM-RT file.
* [*tunable\_parameters.yaml*](tunable_parameters.yaml): yaml file specifying the values each of tunable parameter illustrated in Figure X of the manuscript.

Empty templates (with default suggested values for *tunable_parameters.yaml*) of both files are provided.

## Outputs

## Usage
`run.py` is the main script. It is composed of different parts that handle inputs import, DICOM re-slicing and rotation, transformation from DICOM to World Coordinate System (WCS) and tumour and mould modelling. This script connects all the steps in the pipeline and calls to specific functions defined in [utils](utils).

```bash
python run.py your-mould-id [OPTIONS]
```

A string of your mould ID is the only required input. Additionally, there are multiple options (with default values) and flags that can be passed to this script.
### Options:
-  `--tunable_parameters PATH ` Path to the yaml file specifying the tunable parameters. By default, this is simply *tunable\_parameters.yaml* and calls to file under this name in the working directory.
-  `--dicom_info PATH         ` Path to the yaml file specifying the DICOM information. By default, this is simply *dicom\_info.yaml* and calls to file under this name in the same directory as the code.
-  `--results_path PATH       ` Path to the folder where to save the results. A subfolder under your-mould-id will be created. By default, this corresponds to a folder called *results* in the working directory.
-  `-h                        `  Show this help message and exit.

### Flags:
-  `--display                 ` If added, the code displays the masks for the ROIs before and after rotation.
-  `--save_preproc            ` If added, the code saves the tumour stl mesh before smoothing.
-  `--save_scad_intermediates ` If added, the code saves the scad files of each individual parts of the mould (i.e. the mould cavity, mould cavity + baseplate, slicing guide, orientation guides, and complete mould without slits).
